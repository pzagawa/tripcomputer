## TripComputer

This is personal off-road GPS navigation utility for Android.
Created for active people, who love trips by hike or bike.

Application has navigation features, like waypoint bearing, distance, compass direction, estimated time, current location. All these information will guide in your off-road trip.

This app was started in year 2009 using very first Android SDK with emulator. I did not had access to physical device then. However, app was quite a success and was working very well.

Because this app entered very first Google Android developer competition, later I was awarded by Google with free Nexus One phone.
